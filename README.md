# Matplotlib-Plotting

# Plotting x and y points
The plot() function is used to draw points (markers) in a diagram.

By default, the plot() function draws a line from point to point. 

The function takes parameters fro specifying points in the diagram.

Parameter 1 is an array containing the points on the x-axis.

Parameter 2 is an array containing th epoints on the y-axis.

If we need to plot a line from (1, 3) to (8, 10), we have to pass two arrays [1, 8] and [3, 10] to the plot function.

Example

Draw a line in a diagram from position (1, 3) to position (8, 10):

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    xpoints = np.array([1, 8])
    ypoints = np.array([3, 10])

    plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)
    plt.show()
